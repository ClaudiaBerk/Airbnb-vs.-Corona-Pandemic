## Data Exploration

This is an R Markdown document in which the data for the project is explored. In this document you will find out how all of the raw data files are programmatically downloaded from the internet. Besides that, information about the content of the raw data files and the definition of the variables is provided. 

The data is downloaded from insideairbnb.com and provides detailed listings data from AirBnB in cities from all around the world. Since the data is available in quarters of the year, 4 raw data files are being imported into Rstudio. 

### Preparing the data
Since the data is split up into 4 raw data files, and need to be merged for the whole research project, these raw data files need preparation before merging.

```{r importing 4 raw csv data files, message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# importing the 4 raw data files
listings_london_qrt4 <- read_csv("http://data.insideairbnb.com/united-kingdom/england/london/2021-12-07/data/listings.csv.gz")
listings_london_qrt3 <- read_csv("http://data.insideairbnb.com/united-kingdom/england/london/2021-09-09/data/listings.csv.gz")
listings_london_qrt2 <- read_csv("http://data.insideairbnb.com/united-kingdom/england/london/2021-06-07/data/listings.csv.gz")
listings_london_qrt1 <- read_csv("http://data.insideairbnb.com/united-kingdom/england/london/2021-03-05/data/listings.csv.gz")

```

#### Creating a new variable: quarter
To distinguish the different raw data files in the merged data file, a new variable is created: quarter. This variable indicates the original data file by a number (1, 2, 3 or 4).  

```{r creating new variable: quarter}
# creating a new variable: quarter. This indicates the original data file (1, 2, 3, 4)

listings_london_qrt1$quarter <- c(1)
listings_london_qrt2$quarter <- c(2)
listings_london_qrt3$quarter <- c(3)
listings_london_qrt4$quarter <- c(4)

# rearranging the order of the columns in such a way that quarter is the second column
listings_london_qrt1 <- listings_london_qrt1 %>% 
  select(id, quarter, listing_url:reviews_per_month)
listings_london_qrt2 <- listings_london_qrt2 %>% 
  select(id, quarter, listing_url:reviews_per_month)
listings_london_qrt3 <- listings_london_qrt3 %>% 
  select(id, quarter, listing_url:reviews_per_month)
listings_london_qrt4 <- listings_london_qrt4 %>% 
  select(id, quarter, listing_url:reviews_per_month)

```

#### Merging the 4 data files into 1 data file
Merge all the 4 data files into 1 data file to get started with the data exploration.
**How can this be combined into 1 piece of code?**

```{r merging the 4 data files into 1 data file}
# Merging the 4 data files into 1 data file.
listings_london <- rbind(listings_london_qrt1,
            listings_london_qrt2,
            listings_london_qrt3,
            listings_london_qrt4)

# Rearranging the order of the rows. 
listings_london <- listings_london %>% 
  arrange(id, quarter)

View(listings_london)
```

### Research

Before moving on to exploring the data, the idea of the research is provided once again: 

**Research question**: Which types of rooms in which neighborhoods benefitted the most from the Corona Pandemic in London, United Kingdom?

***Variables***:

*Neighbourhoods (31)*

- Rating score
- Number of bookings
- Price increase

*Room Types (4)*

- Rating score
- Number of bookings
- Price increase

### Let's take a look at the data

This summary provides an insight into the raw data files that has been imported. We can check what the column names of the variables are, if the variables have the right class and check whether there are missing values in the dataset. 

```{r summary of whole dataset message=FALSE}
summary(listings_london)
```

To come back to our variables, we can now assign the column names to the variables.

**Variables**:

- Neighbourhood:      neighbourhood_cleansed
- Room types:         room_type
- Rating scores:      review_score_rating
- Price increase:     price
- Number of bookings: calculated_host_listings_count
                      **OR** host_listings_count

As you can see in the summary, the variable price is imported as a character. This has to be changed to a numeric variable.

```{r change price variable, include=FALSE}
# remove the dollar sign and commas (for prices above thousand)
listings_london$price <- gsub('[$,]', '', listings_london$price)

# changing price variable from character to numeric
listings_london$price <- as.numeric(listings_london$price)

# check for the results
class(listings_london$price)
```

```{r removing missing values from rating score  and number of bookings variables, include=FALSE}
# How to deal with the missing values? Just delete them or what is the idea?

```

### Exploring the data

Looking into the (in)dependent variables of our research project to get a feel for the dataset.

```{r summaries of the independent variables}
summary(listings_london$price)
summary(listings_london$review_scores_rating)
summary(listings_london$host_listings_count)
table(listings_london$neighbourhood_cleansed)
table(listings_london$room_type)
```

The rating score variable has a lot of missing values (NA's), 85.842 missing in total. Since this is an important variable in the research project, it has to be dealt with. **How?**
The rating score is also measured in two different ways, namely on a 0-100 (quarter 1) scale and 0-5 (quarter 2-4) scale. Because of this, the mean score on this variable can not be measured and has to be changed. Either to the 0-100 scale or the 0-5 scale. 

It looks like there is one or more outliers for the variable host_listings_count (ook calculated_host_listings_count hebben deze outliers.). This variable has nearly 2.000 missing values, which needs to be dealt with.

## To Do

List of things that needs to be done:

- Renaming the column names, some are hard to write in the code.
- Detecting the outliers for the number of bookings variable through a simple plot.
- Deal with the missing values of the key variables in our project.
- Changing the measurement scale of the rating score variable.
- Deleting (?) the columns that we do not need.
