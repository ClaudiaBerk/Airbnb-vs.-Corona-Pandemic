Interested in the effects of the Corona Pandemic on the market of traveling and tourisme? Then you're in the right place!

It seems obvious that the Corona Pandemic, which finally seems to be coming to an end, has had the result of strongly reduced travel and overnight stays. Both locally and nationally. However, nothing could be further from the truth. There are certainly Airbnb hosts who have benefited from the Corona Pandemic.

## 1. RESEARCH MOTIVATION
It is generally known that the impact of the Corona Pandemic on the traveling and tourism market has been enormous. Due to Corona measures, it even was almost impossible to travel between countries. However, the traveling and toerism market undergone some changes - either positively or negatively - over time.  

Whereas for many countries the Corona Pandemic played a huge role in daily life at the beginning of 2021, this was much less the case at the end of 2021. As the United Kingdom was one of the countries that let go of the Corona measures first. It is interesting to see whether there are certain changes in the traveling and tourism market in the United Kingdom. For this short research project the general question reads as follows: "*Which types of rooms in which neighbourhoods benefited the most from the Corona Pandemic in London, United Kingdom?*"

## 6. RESEARCH METHOD 
To address the aforementioned research question multiple AirBnB datasets, derived from InsideAirbnb, are combined to one big dataset containing data from three cities in the United Kingdom: London, Bristol and Great Manchester. In total 11 different datasets are combined, each containing information per quarter.  

However, the raw dataset contain lots of information, of which many is not needed to address the research question this repository is dedicated to. Therefore the data is cleaned and prepared for analyses. For more information about this read: **(ADD LINK README IN SRC/DATA_PREPARATION FOLDER)**
